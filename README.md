## Introduction

Welcome to the Feature Request Board Documentation. This guide is designed for users, developers, and stakeholders to understand and participate in the feature request process. The feature request board is a centralized space to collect, evaluate, and prioritize new features or improvements suggested by the community.

## Accessing the Feature Request Board

To access the Feature Request Board, visit [Feature Request Board Live Link](https://mahmud-feature-request-board.vercel.app). Follow these instructions:

## For Full Access To Feature Details

2. Navigate to the Feature Request Board section.

## Feature Request Board Section

Unauthenticated users can view the list of feature requests and individual feature details. They can also like/unlike feature requests, but cannot comment. There is sorting, filtering, searching, and pagination option for better experience.

## Submitting a Feature Request

### Steps:

1. Click on the "Create Request" button.
2. Fill out the provided form with a clear and concise title and a detailed description of the proposed feature.
3. Click "Submit" to post your feature request.

## Review Process

Once a feature request is submitted, it goes through a review process:

1. **Initial Review**: The product team will review the request for completeness and clarity.
2. **Discussion**: The request may be opened for discussion within the community or development team to gather additional insights.
3. **Evaluation**: The product team assesses the feasibility, impact, and alignment with the overall product roadmap.
4. **Status Update**: The status of the request is updated, indicating whether it is Under Review, Planned, In Progress, or Pending further evaluation.

## Feature Request Statuses

Understanding the status of a feature request is crucial. Here are the common statuses:

- **Pending**: The request is under consideration and open for discussion.
- **Under Review**: The product team is actively evaluating the request.
- **Planned**: The feature request has been approved and added to the product roadmap.
- **Deleted**: The request is not currently planned for implementation.
- **In Progress**: The feature is being developed.
- **Complete**: The feature has been developed and incorporated into the product.

## Voting on Feature Requests

Users can like/unlike feature requests to express their interest and support. The number of likes helps prioritize features. Unauthenticated users are limited to viewing feature details.

## Commenting on Feature Requests

Authenticated users can comment on feature requests to provide additional insights, feedback, or clarification. Users can also delete and update their own comments. Unauthenticated users are limited to viewing feature details.

## Admin Panel

The admin panel provides additional functionality for administrators:

- **Dashboard:** View current activity of users.
- **Dashboard/Features:** See all feature requests, update their current status and delete requests.
- **Dashboard/Users:** Make users admin and delete users.
- **Dashboard/Settings:** Control full website functionality, modify important data, set default sorting option and change the website logo.
